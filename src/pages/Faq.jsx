        <h3>How do I make more money with my residential property?</h3>
        <p className="about">
          Real estate presents diverse investment opportunities that guarantee
          solid ROIs in the short term and long term, including on residential
          property. Simply put, when you invest in a residential property, (a
          property specifically for a living), you can also earn returns from
          it. However, there’s a big but, as you must have the requisite
          knowledge and guidance. First off, be sure not to do this out of
          desperation or ignorance. In no particular order, here are some of the
          most profitable options for an investor:

        <h3>House Flipping:</h3>
        <p className="about">
          This is when you invest in a home, not to live in it, but to trade it
          off at a higher price, that’s the flip part. If you are one to watch
          real estate reality shows, you’ll see that house flipping has become
          trendy, investors transform a home from an eyesore to an incredible
          home. But it’s not as easy as it looks on TV. House flipping can mean
          both investing in a property and selling it at a higher rate than you
          invested after some time has passed or doing a fixer-upper first and
          then selling it afterwards. Whichever route you take the idea is to
          buy low and sell high.

        <h3> Rental Property:</h3>
        <p className="about">
          Easily the most common real estate investment option and maybe the
          oldest. You put your residential property up for monthly and yearly
          rentals. It does have its upsides and downsides. A big plus is that
          it’s a steady income source, in addition to asset appreciation, and
          eventually house flipping. Downsides are: managing tenants, for some
          it’s a hassle, vacancies mean no income, properties in hot zones are
          more sought after than others, so there’s the possibility of investing
          without returns due to the unavailability of interested tenants.
          Nonetheless, rental property investment is a brilliant plan to ensure
          recurrent ROI. Don't forget landlords make money in their sleep.

        <h3>Property Development:</h3>
        <p className="about">
          Now this is the most capital-intensive of them all, but sometimes with
          big risks come big rewards. This involves investing in land, erecting
          residential properties, and then selling them off at really
          high-profit margins. In terms of profit, think double or triple your
          investment amount. A major challenge besides the huge capital demand
          is also the consideration of a quality location.

          As promising as these options are before you venture into them, it’s
          advisable to do thorough research, ask questions, surround yourself
          with the right people and know the property laws. At this juncture, if
          you are really committed to expanding your investment portfolio to
          include quality real estate investment, don’t you think it would be
          best to have an investment advisor discuss these options with you and
          guide you?
